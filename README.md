Code/data for Wood et al. (in prep) Global Jukebox/Cantometrics launch

GJBIRRPreReg.R contains all code for exploratory analyses used to prepare the pregistered inter-rater reliability analyses, including power analysis and prepared code for the eventual confirmatory analysis. This code reads data directly from a password-protected Google Sheet, but an Excel version of that spreadsheet as of 2020-09-04 was downloaded and uploaded for those without password access.
