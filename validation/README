## Data cleaning, checking, validating

This is for code used in cleaning and validating the cantometrics dataset. The code can be re-run using data available in this repository.


### Installation Guide/Dependencies

#### Python Version 3.4


You must have a working version of Python 3 installed.
You may download it here https://www.python.org/downloads/

To check to see if your Python has been added to your path open terminal and type:

`python --version`

Ensure that your pip distribution is for Python 3.

`pip --version`

If you get and error, refer to online forums on how to get around this, as the solutions are installation specific, and vary depedning on your operating system.

If all is well until now, you may proceed to install dependencies

`pip install -r requirements.txt`


Error checking:
    Main code is in "automatic_screening.py"

Notes:

    I haven't tested the code yet, but it's probably close-to if not completely ready
    The path names need to be changed, but I guess that one person should be in charge of
    deciding on the directory layout

    The code cannot be run without three sets of files:
        codings.json
        ".npy" for each recording (pYIN)
        ".score.csv" for each recording (Marolt)


### Error checking

We checked for multiple types of errors. All of these analyses can be re-run using "src/automatic_screening.py":

From this directory simply run:

`python  src/automatic_screening.py'


### Inter-rater aggreement and accuracy

Code for calculating kappa, accuracy (and other meaures) can be re-run using "src/interrater_agreement.py":

From this directory simply run:

`python  src/interrater_agreement.py'
