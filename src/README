Error checking:
    Main code is in "validating_methods.py"

Notes:

    I haven't tested the code yet, but it's probably close-to if not completely ready
    The path names need to be changed, but I guess that one person should be in charge of
    deciding on the directory layout

    The code cannot be run without three sets of files:
        codings.json
        ".npy" for each recording (pYIN)
        ".score.csv" for each recording (Marolt)
